BookmarkTab
===========

Overview
--------

This is a replacemnt for the deafult New Tab page in [Google Chrome][chrome].  It provides a simple interface to the Bookmarks system.  It is currently possible to click to open a link and delete the link from bookmarks (you **cannot** undo this).  The last displays the bookmark group designated as the temporary group.  This can be used to use a quick temporary bookmark for a page instead of keeping it open in a tab until there is time to look at it.

Options
-------

Certain groups can be hidden from view.  This is useful for hiding the Bookmarks Bar and bookmark groups used by some extensions to synchronize data.  

*Please note* that the Other Bookmarks gorup used to wrap all the user's non-bookmarks-bar bookmarks is not shown in the output to avoid clutter.  If you select it as hidden in the options page, all the non-bookmarks-bar bookmarks will be hidden.

The Temporary Bookmarks goup can be selected on the options page.

Distribution
------------

This extension will be available in the [Google Chrome Extensions][extensions] list as soon as it has been sufficiently tested.
